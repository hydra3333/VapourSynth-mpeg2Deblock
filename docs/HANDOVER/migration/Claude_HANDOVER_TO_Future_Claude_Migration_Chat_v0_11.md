# Claude handover to future Claude - migration chat

**Filename:** Claude_HANDOVER_TO_Future_Claude_Migration_Chat_v0_11.md
**Version:** 0.11 (supersedes v0.10; adds section 0.NOW2: Stage B+ CLOSED, O1-O7 decided, CI proven for both projects)
**Date:** 2026-10-11
**Role:** Claude = independent cold reviewer in the **migration chat only** (role 1 of the document taxonomy).
**Why now:** the migration ChatGPT chat reached its length limit on 2026-10-10 (about 12:20). Claude wrote ChatGPT's replacement handover, `ChatGPT_Migration_Chat_Handover_v0_10.md`, at Dave's request. This chat is long too. Knowledge comes first; status, history and the reading list come after.

---

## 1. Knowledge first: what a future Claude must know

### 1.1 The job

- Move GitHub `hydra3333/Mpeg2BlockInspector` to `hydra3333/VapourSynth-mpeg2Deblock`.
- Active local repository: `E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\MULTIMEDIA\VapourSynth-mpeg2Deblock\VapourSynth-mpeg2Deblock`.
- Old tree `E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\MULTIMEDIA\Mpeg2BlockInspector\Mpeg2BlockInspector`: rollback and reference only. Do not touch it until the migrated tree passes its checks.
- **Workflow:** ChatGPT drafts and maintains the Stage documents. Claude cold-reviews. Dave decides, runs everything on Windows and commits.
- **Review style:** findings are classed MUST / SHOULD / OPTIONAL / NO OBJECTION, each with file:line and a scripted check. Decisions go to Dave as question / why / recommendation / options, in plain English.

### 1.2 Dave's standing rules (all still in force)

1. Verify against the files and cite file and line. Label anything not verified as unverified. Disagree with ChatGPT, or with my own earlier review, where the evidence supports it.
2. Nothing destructive without Dave's explicit go: no GitHub rename, no deletes, no history rewrite, no force push. Stop at each decision and each check.
3. The inspector **source is frozen**: files may move, their content may not change. The inspector **project configuration** is in scope.
4. **No defaults:** "we should not rely on default behaviours for settings since microsoft are well known for fiddling with things in their releases." Every setting is written explicitly in the project XML.
5. Every document Claude produces is US-ASCII with CRLF line endings, checked by script, and named `Claude_<TOPIC>_vX_Y.md`. Repository files such as `README.md` keep their names.
6. Keep chat replies short and put the detail in the file.
7. Licence wording: AGPL, "version 3 or any later version".
8. At the end, Dave needs a short summary of the final layout and every path that changed.
9. **Policy:** target performance where possible, but never at the expense of security. Target AVX2 PCs, which have been around for a decade or more. This applies to both the VS2026 settings and GitHub Actions.

### 1.3 The document taxonomy: never cross it

| Role | Documents | Who edits |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Migration continuity | `ChatGPT_Migration_Chat_Handover_v0_*`, `Claude_HANDOVER_TO_Future_Claude_Migration_Chat_v0_*` | the migration chat |
| 2. Common handback | `MPEG2_Deblocking_Developer_Handback_v0_*` | ChatGPT drafts, Claude reviews |
| 3. Development-chat handovers | `ChatGPT_Handover_To_Future_ChatGPT_MPEG2_Deblocking_Project_v0_*`, `Claude_HANDOVER_TO_Future_Claude_Chat_v0_*` | **only the development chats. The migration chat never edits these.** |

Lesson already learned: I once wrote a role-3 `Claude_HANDOVER_TO_Future_Claude_Chat_v0_5`, withdrew it and Dave deleted it. Do not repeat that.

### 1.4 Stage plan

| Stage | What it covers | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A | Inspector normalisation plus the `.slnx` | A1 and A2 done; A3 in candidate review |
| B | VapourSynth API4 DLL placeholder: entry point only, no algorithm | not started |
| C | Canonical build harness: vswhere + MSBuild on the `.slnx` | not started |
| D | Release workflow that calls the same harness; no `cl` flag map | not started |
| E | Wheel/PyPI scaffold | not started |
| End | Common handback, then the final summary | not started |

### 1.5 Ratified build decisions

| ID | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | Release `/GL` + `/LTCG`. The `/O2` components (`/Oi /Ot /Ob2 /GF /Gy`) are written explicitly as pins, not changes. |
| D2 | Windows SDK unpinned; record the SDK actually used. |
| D3 (a) | Debug `FavorSizeOrSpeed=Speed`, `InlineFunctionExpansion=AnySuitable`, `IntrinsicFunctions=true`. |
| D4 = NO | `/MT` is consolidated into A3; there is no A4. If an index fails, bisect with uncommitted variants in this order: ISA, then `/MD`, then `/GL`+`/LTCG`, then host. |
| D5 | The plugin DLL uses `/MT`; "hybrid" only as a fallback. |
| D6 | Release `/PDBALTPATH:%_PDB%`. |
| O7 = YES | `/favor:blend` in Debug and Release. |
| AVX2 | x64 + AVX2 minimum for both projects, Debug and Release. Non-AVX2 budget CPUs are unsupported, and the README says so. |
| Security | `/GS`, CFG and CET ON in both configurations. `/sdl` is OFF for the inspector only (frozen reference-decoder exception) and ON for the plugin. `/fp:precise`, with `/fp:contract` absent. |
| Spectre | **Removed by Dave** on threat-model grounds; I agreed. It is pinned explicitly as `SpectreMitigation=false` in the `Label="Configuration"` group. M7 and MSB8040 are superseded. |
| S15 | LP timing: three runs before A3 and three after, for information only. |
| O8 | `/guard:ehcont` (`GuardEHContMetadata` exists in v180 `cl.xml`). Open, for Stage B. |

### 1.6 Distribution and licensing

- **Standalone Release:** the imports must contain none of `VCRUNTIME*`, `MSVCP*`, `api-ms-win-crt-*`, `ucrtbase*`, `CONCRT*`, `VCOMP*` or `MSVCR1*`. The inspector's allowed set is `KERNEL32.dll`. Do not use a bare `MSVCR*` pattern: it would match the system `msvcrt.dll`.
- **Runtime ownership:** no CRT-owned memory or objects cross the `/MT` DLL boundary. VapourSynth resources go through `vsapi`.
- **One build route:** the project XML is the only source of settings. The harness and CI never inject flags.
- **Licence:** AGPL-3.0-or-later. `NOTICE.md` is the legal and test-media boundary. The wheel must not copy CNR3's MIT metadata (CNR3 workflow line 198 says `License: MIT`).
- **CNR3 reference points:**
  - its workflow (lines 88-128) uses a hand-written `cl` flag map with `/MD` and `/arch:AVX2`, which we do not copy;
  - its wheel is `py3-none-win_amd64` with layout `vapoursynth/plugins/cnr3/cnr3.dll` (lines 165-257);
  - its local `1.BUILD.bat` uses vswhere + MSBuild.

### 1.7 MSBuild lessons (hard-won, keep applying)

- **MSBuild silently ignores unknown item metadata.** Every XML pin must be proven against Dave's installed VS2026 **v180** rule XML (`...\MSBuild\Microsoft\VC\v180\1033\*.xml`) on all of:
  - rule/tool;
  - the exact element name;
  - the enum or bool value;
  - placement (DataSource);
  - the toolset folder (v170 and v160 rows in the CSV do not count).
- **Placement facts from the v180 scan:**
  - `SpectreMitigation`, `WholeProgramOptimization`, `CharacterSet` and `PreferredToolArchitecture` go in `PropertyGroup Label="Configuration"`, **before** the `Microsoft.Cpp.props` import.
  - `WholeProgramOptimization` also exists in CL (`/GL`). Set it in both places, as CNR3 does.
  - `LinkIncremental`, `GenerateManifest` and `LinkControlFlowGuard` go in an unlabelled conditioned `PropertyGroup`.
  - The linker's error-reporting property is `LinkErrorReporting=QueueForNextLogin`. CL's `ErrorReporting=Queue` is a different property. `Link/ErrorReporting` does **not** exist (finding R1).
  - `GenerateDebugInformation` takes `false;true;DebugFastLink;DebugFull`. The pin is `DebugFull`.
  - There is no HighEntropyVA property, so use `/HIGHENTROPYVA` in Link `AdditionalOptions`.
  - `CETCompat`, `ManifestEmbed` and `ManifestInput` are Link metadata. `EnableSegmentHeap` is Manifest (`mt.xml`) metadata. `RemoveUnreferencedCodeData` gives `/Zc:inline`; `ProgramDataBaseFileName` gives `/Fd`.
  - A `false` BoolProperty with a `ReverseSwitch` **emits** that reverse switch (for example `/Gy-` or `/OPT:NOREF`). The predicted delta must list these.
- **Setting one property can switch on a toolset default for another.** Setting `LinkTimeCodeGeneration` (even `Default`) caused `/LTCGOUT`. Pin `LinkTimeCodeGenerationObjectFile` empty. "Emits nothing" must be judged on the whole command line, which is exactly what the mechanical W1 token diff does.
- **One owner per emitted switch** (U1). Do not add a lower-level property for a switch a higher-level one already produces (`EnableSegmentHeap` -> `/manifestinput`).
- **Expected keys come from evidence, not by hand.** The 82 native-tlog tokens break down as Debug CL 25, Release CL 23, Debug LINK 16 and Release LINK 18. Add the four `/errorReport` switches, which appear only in the detailed MSBuild log, to get 86. The default library list is a `DELIBERATE_EXCEPTION`, proven by the Release import gate.

### 1.8 Checkpoint baseline (after A1 `d38d56d6` and A2 `837df123`)

- **Toolchain:** MSBuild 18.10.1.42706, v145, VCTools 14.51.36231, HostX86\x64, SDK 10.0.28000.0.
- **Warnings:**
  - Release: 17.
  - Debug: 20 (the Release 17, plus C4013 strcat at `spatscal.c:91` and `store.c:217`, plus LNK4075).
- **Exe hashes:** Debug `66be0a77...8bb9`; Release `d31fbad8...c6f8`.
- **Indexes:** all six byte-identical. Cleanup restored only `.log` files.
- **Checkpoint command lines** (from the token CSV):
  - Debug CL: `/c /ZI /JMC /nologo /W3 /WX- /diagnostics:column /sdl- /Od /D _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS /Gm- /EHsc /RTC1 /MDd /GS /fp:precise /Zc:wchar_t /Zc:forScope /Zc:inline /Fo /Fd /external:W3 /Gd /TC /FC`
  - Release CL: the same, but `/Zi`, `/O2` and `/MD`, with no `/JMC` and no `/RTC1`.
  - LINK: `/OUT /INCREMENTAL:NO /NOLOGO <default libs> /MANIFEST /MANIFESTUAC:level='asInvoker' uiAccess='false' /manifest:embed /MANIFESTINPUT:<segmentheap> /DEBUG /PDB /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE [Release: /OPT:REF /OPT:ICF] /TLBID:1 /DYNAMICBASE /NXCOMPAT /IMPLIB /MACHINE:X64`
- **Dumpbin:**
  - DLL characteristics `8160` (HEVA, Dynamic base, NX, TS Aware), with no Guard flag;
  - Guard Flags `0x100`, function count 0;
  - Release imports `VCRUNTIME140`, 8 `api-ms-win-crt` DLLs and `KERNEL32`;
  - Debug imports `VCRUNTIME140D`, `ucrtbased` and `KERNEL32`;
  - the `cv` entry holds the full PDB path.
- **A1 project:** `Mpeg2BlockInspector.vcxproj`, SHA-256 `87acd9ad...7a57`. It already has `Manifest/EnableSegmentHeap=true` (lines 49 and 63) and **no** `ManifestInput`. EnableSegmentHeap is what produced the checkpoint `/MANIFESTINPUT`.

### 1.9 Published state

- `main` = `ab145f5`; interim checkpoint `b4dace0` (the README was committed there with the old Spectre wording, since corrected).
- Tags: pre-Stage-A `b38fde11`; post-restructure `a9c782ac`.
- Dave pushes as an offsite backup after review-driven updates.

## 0.NOW2 LATEST STATE (2026-10-11 09:20 Adelaide). Read this first; it supersedes 0.NOW where they differ.

**Where we are:** Steps 0, 1 and 2 (Stage B+) are CLOSED, subject to Dave ratifying my last review. Next is **step 3, the final release workflow**, then step 4, the handback.

**Dave's O1-O7 decisions** (Migration_Status v0.5, 2026-10-10):
- O1 names: VS project `mpeg2Deblock`, `src\mpeg2Deblock`, `mpeg2Deblock.dll`, namespace `mpeg2deblock`, ID `com.hydra3333.mpeg2deblock`, future PyPI `vapoursynth-mpeg2deblock`, autoload folder `mpeg2Deblock`.
- O2 `/guard:ehcont` ON for BOTH the inspector and the DLL.
- O3 VERSIONINFO, with one owner, `plugin_version.h`.
- O4 Large Address Aware ON for both (he overrode my "drop").
- O5 AVX2 everywhere, with NO runtime CPU check, ever.
- O6 NO parallel technical work until the migration ends.
- O7 six indexes LOCAL ONLY, never in CI; Dave accepts the CI-binary risk.

**Stage B+ (what was done):**
- Candidate v0.1, then my review B1-B6:
  - B1: native `GuardEHContMetadata` in ClCompile plus `LinkGuardEHContMetadata` in the PropertyGroup;
  - B2: DLL defines `NOMINMAX;_DEBUG|NDEBUG;_WINDOWS;_USRDLL`;
  - B3: `SubSystem=Windows`;
  - B4: `EnableUAC=false`;
  - B5: ResourceCompile pins;
  - B6: `RuntimeTypeInfo`, plus the full token audit.
- v0.2: diff-checked, ratified and applied.
- Inspector changes against A3: `PlatformToolset=$(DefaultPlatformToolset)` plus a numeric minimum-v145 guard target (`BPlus_MinimumPlatformToolset`, BeforeTargets PrepareForBuild), and native EHCONT. Nothing else changed.
- Local gates A-F (`Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_StageBPlus_Final_Gate_v0_1.md`): ACCEPT.
  - Inspector 113 to 117 tokens (+`/guard:ehcont` x4).
  - DLL CL, LINK and RC measured: 256 tokens in total.
  - B6 decision: `/D _WINDLL` and `/TLBID:1` accepted as toolchain-inherited, and annotated in the CSV.
  - Guard Flags 10417500. EH continuation count: inspector 0xF, DLL 0xB.
  - Portable VapourSynth R81 `Identity` PASS.
  - **Six indexes PASS** (a new, real result; A3 v0.10 stays WAIVED).
- The CI proving workflow was rewritten for both projects (`expected_stage_bplus_switches.csv`, 256 rows plus a `disposition` column).
  - My v0.1 review raised F1 (version read from `plugin_version.h`), F2 (SDK recorded from the build log), F3 (EH count may be 0) and F4 (header). The v0.2 diff check was ready.
  - Run 38092449456 at `3ccfa182`: ALL PASS. 256/256 switches; 8/8 HostX64 groups, zero HostX86; 17/17 warnings; SDK 10.0.26100.0 recorded. `Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_StageBPlus_Step4_CI_Run_v0_1.md`: ACCEPT. **K2 CLOSED.**
- The A3 CSV is kept as history.

**Small open items:**
- Migration_Status should say "Dave ran the structure validator" (step 0), not "Claude confirmed".
- The six regenerated tracked test `.log` files: Dave's decision (restore just those six, or commit them).

**Step 3 backlog:**
- start from the proven workflow;
- add the `release` trigger;
- S4: upload the Release EXE, DLL and PDBs;
- S6: Node 24 action versions (verify them);
- the G7 commented reference block of known-good CL, LINK and RC lines;
- take counts and B6 tokens from the CSV instead of hard-coding them (G5);
- rename the `$matches` variable;
- the K4 scratch case.

**Step 4:** the final common handback. It records:
- O1-O7, `/fp:precise`, D-SDK (c) and the SDK/UCRT inference;
- the B6 values;
- the build how-to (GUI plus a command-line example);
- what the development chats must do.

## 0.NOW LATEST STATE (2026-10-10 18:25 Adelaide). Read this first; it corrects 0.PLAN where they differ.

**Where we are:** Steps 0 and 1 are CLOSED. Next is **Step 2 (Stage B+)**, waiting on Dave's open items O1-O7 (see 0.PLAN).

**Corrections to 0.PLAN:**
- G6: there is **no test branch**. `main` is the only branch (Dave). Proving runs use the manual button only (`workflow_dispatch`).
- The handback base is now **`MPEG2_Deblocking_Developer_Handback_v0_16.md`** (mine, final say over ChatGPT's v0.15). It accepts ChatGPT's v0.15 corrections and narrows the six-index exemption: a `.filters`-only change needs no rerun, just a record of the new SHA. Infrastructure work that leaves both inspector files untouched needs one LP smoke run. Any inspector `.vcxproj` change, toolset change or exact-compiler change needs all six indexes. v0.14 is superseded.
- **Plugin floating point: Dave decided `/fp:precise` with no automatic contraction** ("yes to /fp:precise if that means use accurate floatingpoint"). Record it in `Migration_Status.md` and the final handback; there is no new handback version for it.

**Step 0 (closed):** the GitHub snapshot content check (my hashes: `.vcxproj` `73e9019c...db46`, `.slnx` `fa24efcd...0754`) and **Dave's structure validator run on the live project: PASS, 140 pin applications.** ChatGPT at first treated step 0 as a hash-only check; I explained that the hash only proves byte-identity with the validated candidate.

**Step 1 (closed): the proving workflow.**
- File: `.github/workflows/prove-project-build-windows-x64.yml`, plus `.github/workflows/expected_a3_v0_10_switches.csv`. The CSV is byte-identical to the A3 post-token CSV (113 tokens).
- My review `Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_Step1_Proving_Workflow_v0_1.md` raised:
  - S1: the line 106 regex, now `'\\bin\\HostX64\\x64\\(?:CL|link)\.exe '`;
  - S2: the file log at `Verbosity=detailed`;
  - S3: the optional probe fallback.
  S1 and S2 were applied and verified before commit.
- What the workflow does:
  - `workflow_dispatch` only, `contents: read`, checkout of `github.sha`, guarded to `main`;
  - isolation guards (environment, `VSCMD_ARG_*`, ancestor `Directory.Build.*` and `MSBuild.rsp`);
  - `vswhere -latest -products '*'` with the MSBuild and VC.Tools.x86.x64 requirements, the amd64 MSBuild, and an `Is64BitProcess` probe;
  - `-noAutoResponse`;
  - an inline Python tlog checker (`CommandLineToArgvW`) and the HostX64 invocation check;
  - dumpbin and mt.exe checks.
- The run: commit `bf2412593e0dd3a93f7b1f0d958e596f9b9abdf5`, run `38034308907`, image `windows-2025-vs2026` `20260925.250.1`.
  - VS2026 **Enterprise** 18.10.2; MSBuild 18.10.1; MSVC 14.51.36231 (CL 19.51.36260.0, LINK and DUMPBIN 14.51.36260.0); **SDK 10.0.26100.0** (Dave: 10.0.28000.0); MSBUILD_IS64=True.
  - All 113 switches match. Debug and Release: 17 warnings each, the same set as Dave's, 0 errors.
  - Release PE: imports are KERNEL32 only, same names, same order. Guard CF count 37, Guard Flags 10017500, CF table identical by name. Manifest identical.
- The binary differs from Dave's: code 28C00 vs 28800, plus data and load-config tables.
  - Cause (my finding, strongly supported, not proven byte-wise because the EXE is not in the artifact): under `/MT` the static UCRT (libucrt.lib) comes from the **Windows SDK** (`Windows Kits\10\lib\<ver>\ucrt\x64`), and the SDKs differ.
  - Every traced difference is in `__acrt_*` code. Some symbols, e.g. `__acrt_FlsGetValue2`, `__acrt_app_verifier_enabled` and `_set_fpcsr`, appear only in Dave's build.
- My review: `Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_Step1_GitHub_Proving_Run_v0_1.md`: ACCEPT. It agrees with `ChatGPT_Step1_GitHub_Proving_Run_Gate_Review_v0_1.md`, and adds the cause and D-SDK.
- **D-SDK, Dave's decision 2026-10-10 18:25: option (c), record only.**
  - The SDK version is recorded on every build. An SDK change does **not** by itself trigger the switch check, warning comparison or six-index rerun.
  - I recommended (a), which would treat the SDK like the compiler. Dave chose (c); respect it and do not re-argue it.
  - Residual fact for the handback: with `/MT` an SDK change alters UCRT code in both binaries.
- Dave's acceptance of Step 1: I took his "yes to (c)" as acceptance and asked him to say if not.
- For Step 3 (not blocking):
  - S4: also upload the Release EXE and PDB in the artifact;
  - S5: workflow line 1 still says "CANDIDATE v0.2 ... not run on GitHub yet";
  - S6: Node 20 deprecation notices for `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/upload-artifact@v4`; move to the current majors (versions unverified, check the release pages);
  - the log names `*_diagnostic.log` actually hold detailed verbosity (cosmetic).

**Process:** ChatGPT updates only the living `Migration_Status.md` (P1). Do not start a document cascade.

**Next (Step 2, Stage B+):** Dave decides O1-O7. Then one candidate and one gate:
- the inspector toolset mechanism: K3 (a), newest installed MSVC toolset (minimum v145), with a numeric guard proven locally;
- the DLL placeholder project (G9/G10, plus `/sdl` ON and `/fp:precise`);
- all six indexes;
- the expected-switch CSV extended for the DLL.

## 0.PLAN THE AGREED REMAINING MIGRATION (Dave and Claude, 2026-10-10 16:19-16:52). Read before anything else.

**Source document:** `Claude_RESPONSE_TO_ChatGPT_Agreed_Remaining_Plan_v0_1.md`. It supersedes my `Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_Remaining_Roadmap_v0_1.md`, and answers `ChatGPT_Remaining_Project_Roadmap_For_Claude_Cross_Review_v0_1.md`.

**Dave's concern, which shapes everything:** too many baby steps and too much time on simple things where the data already exists. Keep the checks that caught real problems (rule-file recognition, W1, dumpbin and imports, the six indexes when code generation changes). Cut the document churn, the nested packages and the re-researching.

**Decisions, agreed with Dave:**

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| G1 | **Stage E (wheel/PyPI) moves to the development chats.** The handback carries the CNR3 packaging facts: `py3-none-win_amd64`, `vapoursynth/plugins/<name>/<name>.dll`, AGPL-3.0-or-later metadata, never CNR3's MIT. DR sections 31-33 are amended at the next stage close. |
| G2 | **The toolset change and Stage B merge into "Stage B+":** one candidate, one gate, all six indexes (because the inspector's toolset mechanism changes). |
| G3 | **No separate local build script.** Dave builds in the **VS2026 GUI**. The development chats follow the documented command lines in the handback. CI is **one self-contained GitHub Actions workflow**, with everything inline and commented; Dave does not want CI logic spread across files. |
| G4 | **CI builds through the project files** (MSBuild on the `.slnx`), with **no `cl` flag map**. CNR3's workflow (`.github/workflows/build-windows-x64-release.yml`, lines 88-128) does use a hand-written flag map with `/MD`, which is a drifting second copy. Triggers: `release` plus `workflow_dispatch`. |
| G5 | **Strict switch check (option 1):** an expected-switch file is kept in the repository. A difference fails the run and prints it; a legitimate change is accepted by updating the file in one commit. **No runner pinning (option 3 is rejected).** |
| G6 | **Prove it first:** a manual-only workflow on a test branch, on the current accepted project, with no Release trigger. |
| G7 | **A commented REFERENCE ONLY block** in the workflow holds the known-good CL/LINK lines, dated 2026-10-10, with the toolchain versions. It is updated in the same commit as the expected file. (I drafted the inspector Release block in chat from the verified tokens, adding `/errorReport:queue` and `/ERRORREPORT:QUEUE` from the detailed log.) |
| G8 | `msvc-dev-cmd` or VsDevCmd only **after** the MSBuild step (environment leak). K4 and N1-N4 apply inside the workflow. |
| G9 | **The DLL placeholder:** CNR3's includes and entry point (`VapourSynthPluginInit2`, `configPlugin`) plus **one trivial function**. Loaded once locally in VapourSynth; CI only builds it. |
| G10 | **DLL settings = the inspector's accepted settings, "extremely close if not identical".** Changes:
- DynamicLibrary;
- C++ (`/std:c++20 /permissive-` per CNR3 workflow line 118, to be confirmed against CNR3's `.vcxproj`);
- **`/sdl` ON (DLL only, project file only; Dave confirmed)**;
- no `_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS`.

Drop the exe-only settings: SubSystem Console, the UAC manifest, `EnableSegmentHeap`. Cross-check with the 113-row reconciliation (57 DLL rows). |
| G11 | **Process P1-P6:**
- P1: one living `Migration_Status.md`; the DR and Knowledge record updated only at stage close; the Plan frozen; the Handback finalised once;
- P2: ChatGPT script-checks its own documents;
- P3: two Claude reviews per stage;
- P4: one flat zip;
- P5: checks as scripts;
- P6: settings derived by diff. |

**Steps:**
- **0. Confirm the settings are in the repository.** Done by me on the GitHub snapshot (13:18): the `.slnx` (x64 only, one project) as CRLF is `fa24efcd...0754`; the project as CRLF is `73e9019c...db46`, with every finding present. `Win32Proj` is only Visual Studio's keyword. Dave still has to confirm the local hashes and `git log -1`.
- **1. The proving workflow.**
- **2. Stage B+.**
- **3. The final workflow.**
- **4. The handback** (with real, pasted build examples), then migration ends.

**Still open (Dave):**
- O1: the name set;
- O2: `/guard:ehcont` on the DLL (I recommended ON, but it is one more difference from the inspector);
- O3: a version resource;
- O4: drop Large Address Aware on the DLL;
- O5: CPU check deferred to technical Stage 7;
- O6: Python Stage 2 in parallel?
- O7: six indexes in CI, or local only?

**Handback v0.14** (`MPEG2_Deblocking_Developer_Handback_v0_14.md`) was **written by me at Dave's request**. It is a role-2 document, normally drafted by ChatGPT.
- It adds a top **section R, "READ FIRST"**, for the development chats: what migration did and why it matters (a settings table with reasons), how to build (GUI, command line, VsDevCmd, with examples to be re-run and pasted from Dave's machine), what never to do and why, the inherited rules (project-file change control, the switch check, the six indexes, toolchain updates, the **`/MT` runtime-ownership rule**), the remaining steps, what they must handle themselves (wheel/PyPI, CPU check, `/sdl`, FP bit-exactness under `/fp:precise` with no contraction, CI switch failures, names, open items), what did not change, how to restart, and where the detail is.
- Sections 12-14 are marked superseded.
- **ChatGPT must use v0.14 as its base**; there must be no parallel v0.14.

**Waiting for:**
- ChatGPT's ACCEPT or corrections on the plan;
- `Migration_Status.md`;
- the draft proving workflow, which I review.

## 1.0000 STAGE A CLOSED (2026-10-10, about 16:00)

**Close-out documents reviewed and accepted** in `Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_StageA_Closeout_DocSet_v0_1.md`, with no MUST or SHOULD findings:
- DR v0.19, Plan v0.14, Handback v0.13, Knowledge v0.5, Handover v0.12;
- the waiver is recorded as WAIVED, never PASS, with Plan section 30's rule kept verbatim and the v0.10-only exception beside it;
- N1-N4 are carried as Stage C/D notes;
- the README is consistent (checked against the pushed snapshot).

**Dave committed and pushed the Stage A close-out.** I have not seen the commit hash; get it from `git log` if it is needed. The tag (for example `post-stageA-vs-normalization`) is optional, and I do not know whether Dave added one.

**Next, in order:**
1. **The post-Stage-A toolset candidate:**
   - `PlatformToolset=$(DefaultPlatformToolset)` plus a numeric minimum-v145 guard target;
   - prove `DefaultPlatformToolset`'s availability before the Configuration group, and the guard, on Dave's machine first;
   - the full gate: W1-style switch check (the expected set should be unchanged while the VS2026 v145 toolset is in use), HostX64, imports, warnings, and the six indexes, because this is a toolset-mechanism change.
2. **Stage B:** the VapourSynth API4 DLL placeholder. Carry forward:
   - x64 and AVX2, Release `/MT`, `/sdl` ON;
   - `SpectreMitigation=false`;
   - `PreferredToolArchitecture=x64`;
   - the empty `LinkTimeCodeGenerationObjectFile` pin;
   - `EnableSegmentHeap` as the single manifest owner, if used;
   - the runtime-ownership rule;
   - the open decisions listed in section 3.
3. **Stages C, D and E**, per the Stage C review v0.3 (M1-M5), K3 (a), K4 and N1-N4.

**Cleanup still pending (Dave's call):**
- tracked `.log` files;
- stale zips in `docs/HANDOVER/migration`;
- the scratch folders, now ignored;
- the evidence folder name (`A3_v0_7_PRE_CANDIDATE`);
- the line-ending policy for the vendored `.h` files;
- eventually the old rollback tree.

## 2.000 LATEST (2026-10-10 15:32): A3 v0.10 ACCEPTED; Stage A in close-out

**Gate result:** `Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_StageA_A3_v0_10_Final_Gate_v0_1.md`. All measured items pass. I verified these independently from the raw evidence zip:
- **W1:** I re-ran the extractor on the four tlogs, and the output CSV is byte-identical to Dave's. The unchanged checker gives PASS: 33 / 32 / 23 / 25 = 113 tokens, no `/LTCGOUT`.
- **Builds and warnings:** Build succeeded, 17 warnings and 0 errors each. Debug and Release have the same 17 unique warnings: C4013 x8, C4101 x1, C4996 x8, and no LNK warnings.
- **Toolchain:** HostX64 only, MSVC 14.51.36231, SDK 10.0.28000.0, MSBuild 18.10.1.
- **W2:**
  - PE32+, 8664, LAA, DLL characteristics `C160` (HEVA, DynBase, NX, CFG, TSAware), CET;
  - non-zero cookie, CF function count 37, Guard Flags `10017500` (dumpbin names: CF instrumented, FID table present);
  - RSDS file name only (D6);
  - `KERNEL32.dll` only;
  - manifest `asInvoker` / `uiAccess=false` / `SegmentHeap`.
- **Accepted as reported:** the hashes (Debug exe `df92319f...a0cc`, Release exe `fc168013...ad48`, `.filters` `a5a794a3...5269`, `.slnx` `fa24efcd...0754`, project `73e9019c...db46`), the frozen hashes plus `git diff` exit 0, and `git status` clean.

**Six-index regression for v0.10: WAIVED by Dave (option (b), 15:31), never PASS.** It is a ratified deviation from Plan section 30 ("no waiver"). The evidence:
1. the CL lines are identical to v0.9's, which passed all six;
2. the only LINK difference is `/LTCGOUT`;
3. the v0.9 and v0.10 Release dumpbin `/headers`, `/loadconfig` and `/imports` captures show zero differences after masking the timestamp, GUID and path. The v0.9 captures are in the GitHub snapshot, `vs/VapourSynth-mpeg2Deblock/StageA_A3_Release_*.txt`.

This is strong evidence, not byte proof. The policy stands: any future toolset, compiler or code-generation change requires the six indexes.

**Other decisions since v0.6:**
- **K3 = option (a).** The compiler build is the one "Visual Studio designates as current for that toolset (normally the newest installed, in-support build)". There is no `VCToolsVersion` override; it is recorded, not pinned.
- **K4.** The harness fails if `Directory.Build.props`, `.targets` or `.rsp` exists in any ancestor of the repository (or unreviewed in-tree). It runs `-noAutoResponse`, and this is to be proven once with a scratch ancestor file.
- **K1/K2/H1 closed** (re-check `Claude_RECHECK_OF_ChatGPT_StageC_K1_K4_DocSet_v0_1.md`). The current documents are DR v0.18, Plan v0.13, Handback v0.12, Knowledge v0.4 and Handover v0.11.
- "Latest" means the newest **released** VS installed and updated on the build machine; previews are never used. Build Tools are eligible (`-products *`).

**Stage C notes N1-N4** (from the gate review):
- N1: the extractor's non-Windows fallback (`shlex posix=False`) mis-splits quoted arguments. Implement Windows splitting rules or fail closed off Windows.
- N2: a HostX64 check must match actual tool-invocation lines. The detailed logs contain "HostX86" 34 times in property-reassignment messages.
- N3: record both the tools folder version (14.51.36231) and the tool file version (dumpbin 14.51.36260.0).
- N4: I corrected my earlier Guard Flags decode, which was from memory.

**Next:** ChatGPT does the Stage A close-out:
- the README consistency check;
- DR v0.19, Plan v0.14, Handback v0.13, Knowledge v0.5 and Handover v0.12, with the gate results, the waiver and N1-N4;
- `git status`;
- commit and push;
- a tag only if Dave wants one.

**My next job:** review those refreshed documents. Check that:
- the waiver is labelled WAIVED with the three-point evidence, never PASS;
- the README matches the accepted build;
- nothing else changed.

After that comes the post-Stage-A toolset candidate: `PlatformToolset=$(DefaultPlatformToolset)` plus a numeric minimum-v145 guard, which must be proven on Dave's machine first. Then Stage B.

## 2.00 NEW STANDING DECISIONS (2026-10-10, about 13:40-14:05): apply to every later review

1. **64-bit everywhere.**
   - The target is x64 only, as it always was.
   - The **host tools** are 64-bit everywhere: `PreferredToolArchitecture=x64` in every project's `Label="Configuration"` group, and evidence must show `HostX64\x64` `CL.exe` and `link.exe`.
   - Developer prompts: `VsDevCmd.bat -arch=amd64 -host_arch=amd64`.
   - 64-bit MSBuild (`Bin\amd64`), and 64-bit Python and helpers.
   - Stage C and D use x64 runners and a log check that the tools are `HostX64\x64`.
   - **The x86 host survives only as the last-resort diagnostic** (option (a)): the final step of the D4 bisect order, local and uncommitted, never shipped.
   - "Host" means the bitness of the compiler programs. Pre-A3 used `HostX86\x64` because nothing was set; A3 made x64 explicit. Nothing in the past changes.
2. **Version independence wherever possible** (Dave's goal), reconciled with no-defaults as **"discover, verify, record"**:
   - no hard-coded VS paths or versions in the harness or CI;
   - one `vswhere` search: `-latest -products * -requires Microsoft.Component.MSBuild Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64`, with no version range;
   - everything derived from that installation root: MSBuild `Bin\amd64`, VsDevCmd, dumpbin (via `VC\Auxiliary\Build\Microsoft.VCToolsVersion.default.txt`, file name unverified).
3. **Compiler policy (Dave's wording, as I refined it):**

   > Use the newest installed MSVC toolset (minimum v145) and the newest installed build of it, with 64-bit host tools. The toolset name and exact compiler version are recorded on every build. If either differs from the last accepted build, the switch check, warning comparison and six-index regression must all pass again before that build is accepted.

   - The later project change: `PlatformToolset=$(DefaultPlatformToolset)`, plus a project-owned guard target failing below v145. The availability of `DefaultPlatformToolset` before the Configuration group and the guard syntax are both unverified; prove them on Dave's machine.
   - **Timing agreed:** record the policy now; make the project change **after Stage A closes**, as a small reviewed candidate. A3 v0.10 stays frozen at v145.
4. **The safety net is mandatory under this policy.** A permanent Stage C/D output check:
   - the expected CL and LINK switch set, versioned in the repository (a permanent W1);
   - `HostX64\x64`;
   - Release imports `KERNEL32.dll` only;
   - a six-index rerun whenever the toolset or compiler version changes.

   A new Visual Studio brings new rule files, and a renamed property is silently ignored (the Q1 lesson). Checking the output is what catches it.
5. **Clean environment (M3):**
   - The harness never runs inside VsDevCmd. MSBuild reads environment variables as properties, so a stray `Platform` could change the build.
   - Fail if `CL`, `_CL_`, `LINK`, `_LINK_` or `Platform` is set. `cl.exe` and `link.exe` read the first four as extra options, bypassing the project.
6. **Still open for Dave:** `-products *` (accept Build Tools installations). I recommended yes, with the choice logged.

**Review:** `Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_StageC_MSBuild_Discovery_Proposal_v0_3.md` (supersedes v0_1 and v0_2) contains M1-M5:
- M1: version-independent discovery plus the permanent output check;
- M2: run-time proof of MSBuild's bitness (a probe of `$(MSBuildToolsPath)` or `Is64BitProcess`; a PE header alone is not proof for a .NET executable);
- M3: clean environment;
- M4: record everything per build;
- M5: the compiler policy and the single discovery chain.

Dave asked ChatGPT (the new migration chat) to review my review and carry all of this, including x64-only, into the DR, Plan, Handback, knowledge record and its handover. **Expect those document updates for review**, and check that:
- nothing changes the production project or interrupts the A3 v0.10 gate;
- the "fixed MSBuild path for the A3 gate only" exception is kept.

**A3 v0.10 gate progress in the new ChatGPT chat** (as reported by Dave):
- Step 1: the four tlogs were located under `vs\VapourSynth-mpeg2Deblock\Mpeg2Blo.F4B1A357\x64\{Debug,Release}\Mpeg2Blo.F4B1A357.tlog\`, timestamped 12:17-12:18.
  - Sizes: Debug CL 17,558, Debug LINK 7,948, Release CL 17,366, Release LINK 8,130.
  - The CL sizes equal v0.9; the LINK sizes are about 130 bytes smaller, consistent with `/LTCGOUT` gone.
  - They were being copied to `A3_v0_10_POST_APPLY_GATE\{Debug,Release}\`.
- `HostX64\x64` was confirmed in both logs.
- The warning comparison was next.

The GitHub snapshot zip checks out:
- the project equals v0.10 after LF-to-CRLF conversion. Git stores the `.vcxproj` and `.slnx` with LF, so **their GitHub-zip hashes (`bd597ea7...`, `505cc03c...`) differ by design; only the Windows working copy's hashes count**;
- the frozen files match;
- `.gitignore` has the three new entries.

## 2.0 LATEST STATE (2026-10-10 12:50): read this before the rest of section 2

**v0.10 is RATIFIED and APPLIED, and its gate is in progress.**

**v0.10 candidate:** v0.9 plus `<LinkTimeCodeGenerationObjectFile />` in the Debug and Release Link sections.
- SHA-256 `73e9019cda7d1061ecdb06526c60f4ee84baa4c385b7ca0dde4269544e4fdb46`.
- My review: `Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_StageA_A3_v0_10_Candidate_v0_1.md` = RATIFIABLE.
  - I verified independently: the two-line diff; pin rows `LD_ltcgout` / `LR_ltcgout`; counts of 140 applications, 143 rows and 134 v180 targets; all six validators PASS.
  - Negative tests: removing an element or giving it a non-empty value both FAIL.
  - `LinkTimeCodeGenerationObjectFile` = `link.xml` StringProperty, `Switch=LTCGOUT:`.
  - X3 is answered honestly. `Microsoft.Link.Common.props:63` sets the `.iobj` default with the condition `'%(Link.LinkTimeCodeGenerationObjectFile)' == ''` only, so the coupling to `LinkTimeCodeGeneration` sits inside the Link task and is recorded empirically.
  - OPTIONAL Y1: the package wrongly carried the stale DR v0_10 and Plan v0_5, probably through a `*v0_10*` filename pattern. Y2: note that S15 was run once each.

**Dave's command log, as applied:**
- The production `vs\VapourSynth-mpeg2Deblock\Mpeg2BlockInspector.vcxproj` hashes to `73e9019c...db46`.
- `git diff` shows only the two added lines, so HEAD holds v0.9 (Dave's earlier snapshot commit).
- Clean `/t:Rebuild` of Debug and Release through the `.slnx`, `/v:detailed`: both RC=0.
- Logs are in `E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\MULTIMEDIA\VapourSynth-mpeg2Deblock\A3_v0_7_PRE_CANDIDATE\A3_v0_10_POST_APPLY_GATE\{Debug,Release}\StageA_A3_v0_10_{Debug,Release}_x64.log`.
- `findstr " /LTCGOUT:"` on both logs: RC=1 (absent). That is encouraging, but it is not the gate.

**The ChatGPT migration chat died** at its length limit. I wrote `ChatGPT_Migration_Chat_Handover_v0_10.md` (US-ASCII, CRLF).
- Section 0.3 holds the full remaining gate sequence:
  1. preserve the four tlogs;
  2. W1 with the extractor and my checker, both unchanged (expect 33 / 32 / 23 / 25);
  3. HostX64;
  4. warnings 17 / 17;
  5. W2 dumpbin;
  6. SHAs;
  7. frozen hashes;
  8. six indexes with return codes;
  9. `.iobj` / `.ipdb` and `git status`;
  10. package the evidence for Claude.
- Dave was given the exact list of 16 files to attach to the new ChatGPT chat.

**Git at 12:49:**
- Dave's `got add -A` typo meant nothing was staged, the commit did nothing and the push was a no-op. He was told to repeat it correctly.
- The working tree showed two tracked files deleted: `docs/HANDOVER/migration/A3_v0_8_to_v0_9.diff` and `CANDIDATE_STRUCTURE_VALIDATOR_PASS.txt`. They may have been moved into a new `docs/HANDOVER/migration/chatgpt_new_chat_stuff_2026.10.10/` folder; unverified.
- Also untracked: `ChatGPT_Migration_Chat_Handover_v0_10.md`, my v0.10 review, the v0.10 package zip, and `chatgpt_new_chat_stuff_2026.10.10.zip` plus its folder.

**Git practice now:**
- Dave uses `git add -A --dry-run`, then `git add -A`, then a "Snapshot: ..." commit and a push as backup. That is fine.
- `.gitignore` now excludes the two scratch folders `vs/A3_LTCGOUT_SCRATCH/` and `vs/A3_LTCG_SUPPRESS_SCRATCH/`, and `vs/VapourSynth-mpeg2Deblock/*.log`, because the detailed MSBuild logs matched `C:\Users` / `USERNAME` style strings.
- Before the snapshot push I checked that no zip contains `.log` or `.tlog` files. Nothing was found.

**My next job:** review the v0.10 gate evidence package from the new ChatGPT chat.
- W1 must PASS unchanged.
- W2 must show PE32+, LAA, HEVA, Dynamic base, NX, TS Aware, CFG with a non-zero function count, CET, the cookie, `KERNEL32.dll` only, D6 file name only, and the manifest present.
- The six indexes must be byte-identical with return codes recorded.
- Frozen hashes unchanged; warnings explained.

If all of that holds, A3 is accepted and Stage A goes to close-out: README consistency, refreshed DR v0.18 / Plan v0.13 / Handback v0.12 / knowledge v0.4, commit, push, and an optional tag that is Dave's call.

## 2. Current position (where to pick up), as of 2026-10-10 11:46 (superseded in part by 2.0)

**A3 history in this round:**
1. **v0.8** (`30999ef3...52f3`): not ratifiable. U1 was the double owner of the segment-heap manifest; U2 was six switches missing from the prediction.
2. **v0.9** (`ebfcde82405fd2dc25aa7a14a160f89375465d545927b3e4583e7a40fd1af668`): reviewed RATIFIABLE (`Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_StageA_A3_v0_9_Candidate_v0_1.md`).
   - The diff against v0.8 removed exactly the two `Link/ManifestInput` lines; `EnableSegmentHeap` is the single owner.
   - Pin rows 81 and 100 were re-pointed, and U2 was added to the prediction.
3. **Dave ratified v0.9 and applied it to the production working tree. It is NOT committed.** The last published commit is `365222b` ("Record A3 v0.9 ratification and migration state"), which still holds the pre-A3 project.

**Post-apply gate status note (ChatGPT), as reported** (raw evidence not yet seen by Claude):
- Debug and Release built on HostX64; the applied project's SHA equals the v0.9 SHA.
- Warnings: Debug 20 -> 17 (2 x C4013 strcat gone with `/Oi`; LNK4075 gone with `/Zi`); Release 17.
- `/Qspectre` and `/fp:contract` absent.
- Release:
  - imports `KERNEL32.dll` only;
  - HEVA, Dynamic base, NX, CFG and CET present;
  - Guard Flags `0x10017500`, CF function count 37;
  - CodeView entry holds the file name only (D6);
  - exe SHA `de564acf...288f`.
- Frozen hashes unchanged (getpic.c `e80239cf...`, mpeg2dec.c `8e6053cc...`, `tools\Stage1_Inspector_Analyzer_v0_2.py` `8e0d5830...`), and `git diff` against the `pre-stageA-vs-normalization` tag is empty.
- All six indexes byte-identical. Four return codes were lost to a typo (W3, optional).
- S15: one run each, 0.653 s pre-A3 and 0.613 s post-A3. PowerShell pipe timing was rejected.
- Evidence root: `E:\SOFTWARE-Win11\MULTIMEDIA\VapourSynth-mpeg2Deblock\A3_v0_7_PRE_CANDIDATE\A3_v0_9_POST_APPLY_GATE`.

**My gate review** (`Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_StageA_A3_v0_9_Post_Apply_Gate_v0_1.md`):
- **W1 (MUST before Stage A closure, not before an interim commit):** a mechanical token check using `Claude_check_A3_post_tokens_v0_1.py`. It compares the checkpoint tokens plus exactly the v0.9 predicted delta against the post-A3 tokens. Expected counts: Debug CL 33, Release CL 32, Debug LINK 23, Release LINK 25.
- **W2 (SHOULD):** the four raw Release dumpbin files, covering LAA, TS Aware, PE32+ and the manifest.
- **W3-W7 (OPTIONAL).**

**W1 result:** both CL lines passed exactly. Each LINK line had exactly one extra token, `/LTCGOUT:...\<cfg>\Mpeg2BlockInspector.iobj`.
- **Cause:** setting `LinkTimeCodeGeneration` explicitly (Debug `Default`, Release `UseLinkTimeCodeGeneration`) makes `Microsoft.Link.Common.props` default `LinkTimeCodeGenerationObjectFile` to `$(IntDir)$(TargetName).iobj`. A1 had neither property, and the checkpoint had no `/LTCGOUT`.
- **Scratch experiment A:** removing Debug `Default` removes `/LTCGOUT` from Debug.
- **Scratch experiment B:** adding `<LinkTimeCodeGenerationObjectFile />` (empty) after each `LinkTimeCodeGeneration` removes `/LTCGOUT` from both; `/LTCG` is kept in Release; both builds RC=0.
- Production is still exactly v0.9.

**Proposed v0.10:** v0.9 plus those two empty elements. My review is `Claude_REVIEW_OF_ChatGPT_StageA_A3_W1_LTCGOUT_and_v0_10_Proposal_v0_1.md`. The checker stays **unchanged**.
- Q1 = yes, use the empty pins.
- Q2 = no, do not remove Debug `Default` instead: it breaks no-defaults and cannot fix Release.
- Q3 = yes, after the MUST items.
- MUST X1: pin rows `LD_ltcgout` / `LR_ltcgout`; the validators must accept an empty value; counts 140 applications and 143 rows.
- MUST X2: the full A3 gate on v0.10, with a clean rebuild, `git status` free of stray `.iobj`/`.ipdb`, W1 unchanged, W2, imports, D6, the six indexes, the frozen hashes and the warnings.
- SHOULD X3: quote the exact props condition with file:line. ChatGPT's "when otherwise empty" does not explain why A1 got no `/LTCGOUT`; the trigger is `LinkTimeCodeGeneration` being set.
- SHOULD X4: knowledge record and predicted delta.
- SHOULD X5: the Stage B plugin gets the same empty pin, and the Stage C/D harness checks for "no /LTCGOUT".

**Next:**
1. ChatGPT, in the same chat if it recovers, otherwise a new chat bootstrapped from its handover, produces the v0.10 package.
2. Claude does a short check: the diff against v0.9 is exactly two added lines, plus the pin table and validators.
3. Dave ratifies, applies, cleanly rebuilds and runs the full gate, including W1 unchanged.
4. Claude reviews the gate, including W2.
5. Stage A close-out.

**ChatGPT's documents at last sight:**
- DR v0.16, Plan v0.11, Handback v0.10;
- ChatGPT migration handover **v0.8**;
- `StageA_VS2026_MSBuild_Hard_Earned_Knowledge_v0_1.md`, which is new: a durable MSBuild lessons record, accurate apart from the inference noted in V1 of my v0.9 review.

## 3. Still to do after A3

1. **Stage B decisions:**
   - the coupled naming and package-identity set;
   - the C++ standard;
   - the header/API profile;
   - FP/FMA;
   - COMDAT;
   - the version resource;
   - O8 `/guard:ehcont`;
   - an optional runtime CPU check;
   - the plugin's `SpectreMitigation=false`, `/sdl` ON and `/MT`.
2. Stage C (harness), Stage D (release workflow, using the same harness), Stage E (wheel: AGPL metadata, not MIT).
3. Review the final handback.
4. Update `Claude_Migration_Final_Summary_v0_1.md`.
5. Make sure each review document is either committed by name or removed.

---

## 4. Process notes

- Every package must carry all the Claude reviews it answers. Twice a review never reached ChatGPT; that was caught and fixed.
- Run `python3 -I` on extracted packages, keep each package in its own directory, and verify the SHA files first.
- ChatGPT sandbox PASS files can contain "Spreadsheet runtime warmup failed" tracebacks. They are noise; trust the LOCAL_PASS files and your own re-runs.
- Errors I have made, so watch for them:
  - a wrong line citation (`mpeg2dec.c` exit codes are lines 178-192);
  - assuming MSB8040 was a warning;
  - the role-3 boundary crossing.
- ChatGPT defects caught so far:
  - the `Link/ErrorReporting` pin;
  - a dropped pin checklist;
  - a loosely matching validator;
  - duplicated headings;
  - a LF-only BAT;
  - the double manifest owner (v0.8);
  - the `/LTCGOUT` side effect, caught by W1 and not by prediction.

## 6. First actions for a new Claude migration chat

1. Read this file, then the latest ChatGPT migration handover, DR, Plan and Handback that Dave attaches.
2. Ask Dave for the latest `Migration_Status.md` and the step 3 final-workflow candidate.
3. Re-run the validators locally against the package's CSVs before trusting any PASS.
